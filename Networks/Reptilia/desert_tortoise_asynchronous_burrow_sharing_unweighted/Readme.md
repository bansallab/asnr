**Study description**|**value**
Attributes Available|not available
Species|*Gopherus agassizii*
Taxonomic class|Reptilia
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Nevada, USA
Data collection technique|radio tags
Interaction type|social projection bipartite
Definition of interaction|A bipartite network was first constructed based on burrow use - an edge connecting a tortoise node to a burrow node indicated burrow use by the individual. Social networks of desert tortoises were then constructed by the bipartite network into a single-mode projection of tortoise nodes.
Edge weight type|unweighted
Total duration of data collection|8 months
Time resolution of data collection (within a day)|
Time span of data collection (within a day)|focal follow/ad libitum
Note|Networks represent social data collected over different years and inactive (November_February)/active (March_October) season.
