Attributes Available|diet
Species|*Gasterosteus aculeatus*
Taxonomic class|Actinopterygii

Definition of interaction|A pair of individuals were classed as shoaling if they were within four body lengths of one another from head to head. Gambit of the group approach was then used to assume that a string of fish connected by less than two body lengths were all assumed to be associating with one another.
