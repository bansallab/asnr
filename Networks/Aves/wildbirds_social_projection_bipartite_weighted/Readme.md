**Study description**|**value**
Attributes Available|not available
Species|*Wild birds N/A*
Taxonomic class|Aves
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Oxford, UK
Data collection technique|RFID
Interaction type|social projection bipartite
Definition of interaction|Groups were defined as individuals detected on the same nest-box during the same day, and co-memberships represented individuals that overlapped in nest-box exploration patterns during the same day. Networks were calculated from these group-by-individual matrices using the halfweight index.
Edge weight type|half_weight_index
Total duration of data collection|6 days
Time resolution of data collection (within a day)|1 sec
Time span of data collection (within a day)|12 hours
Note|Each network represents social data collected for consecutive 6-day time window.
