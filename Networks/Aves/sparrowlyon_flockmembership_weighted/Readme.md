Species|*Zonotrichia atricapilla*
Taxonomic class|Aves
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|California, USA
Data collection technique|survey scan
Interaction type|group membership
Definition of interaction|Flocks were defined as a group of individuals found within a single 5 m radius. For each season, Simple Ratio association index was calculated for each pair of individuals, which ranged from 0 for pairs never seen in the same flock and 1 for pairs always seen in the same flock.

Note|Networks represent social data collected during two non-breeding seasons: October 2010_February 2011 (Season 2) and October2011_April 2012 (Season 3).
