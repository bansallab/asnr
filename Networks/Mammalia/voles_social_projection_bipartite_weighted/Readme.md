**Study description**|**value**
Attributes Available|not available
Species|*Microtus agrestis*
Taxonomic class|Mammalia
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Northumberland, England
Data collection technique|mark recapture
Interaction type|social projection bipartite
Definition of interaction| An edge was inserted into the network whenever two voles were caught in at least one common trap over the primary trapping sessions being considered
Edge weight type| frequency
Total duration of data collection|6 days
Time resolution of data collection (within a day)| 12 hours
Time span of data collection (within a day)| 24 hours
Note| Networks represent social data combined over two consecutive trapping sessions at four sites (BHP, KCS, PLJ and ROB). Populations were trapped in _primary¬ê sessions every 28 days from March to November, and every 56 days from November to March.
