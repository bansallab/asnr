Attributes Available|sex
Species|*Ovis canadensis*
Taxonomic class|Mammalia
Population type|semi-ranging
Geographical location|Montana, USA
Data collection technique|focal sampling
Interaction type|dominance
Definition of interaction|Social status was determined by assembling a win-loss matrix based on the outcome of agonistic interactions. The winner of a dominance fight, involving a series of butts and clashes, was recorded as winning one interaction.
