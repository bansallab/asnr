Definition of interaction|The proximity loggers recorded the identity of interacting individuals (based on a threshold proximity set to detect den-sharing events) and the time and length of those interactions. From these data, den-sharing was recorded as a binary variable with _1 representing an instance of day-time den-sharing and _0 representing the use of separate dens for every pairwise combination of individuals on each of the 223 days of data collection.
