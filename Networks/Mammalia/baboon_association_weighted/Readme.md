**Study description**|**value**
Attributes Available|group, age, dominance rank, date of knockout, type of dispersal
Species|*Papio cynocephalus*
Taxonomic class|Mammalia
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Amboseli National Park, Kenya
Data collection technique|focal sampling
Interaction type|spatial proximity
Definition of interaction|These networks were constructed based on nearest neighbour data collected during focal sampling.
Edge weight type|frequency
Total duration of data collection|30days
Time resolution of data collection (within a day)|
Time span of data collection (within a day)|focal follow/ad libitum
Note|Networks represent grooming interaction or association between five social groups of baboons. Each network  summarizes data collected within 30 days before and 90 days after each knockout. A natural knockout was considered to have occurred when a given alpha or beta male was present in the group for at least three months prior to his disappearance, and then he disappeared permanently from the group.
